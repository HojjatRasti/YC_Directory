```env
# Sanity project settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-08-01

# Sanity API Token (required for authenticated requests)
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_token
```

### üîë How to get these values

* Create an **API token** in the "API" settings section (choose **Read/Write** if you need mutations)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to GitHub. Add it to `.gitignore`.
